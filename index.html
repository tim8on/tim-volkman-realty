					<p>In real estate theres the business model or business side of it, there's the product which is the house or the property, and all of that is really important. But the part that I enjoy most is the people, my clients.</p>
                    <p>Everyone comes with a different motivation, a different experience, different reasons for wanting to buy or sell, and I love to be able to come alongside people and try to understand what's going on inside of them to walk with them in that journey.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<p>For me, the most satisfying part are those serendipitous moments of entering into people's lives to try to understand them, feel with them, and walk with them in understanding, care, and professionalism.</p>
                    <p>Whether it's a young couple looking to buy their first home and sell their starter, older folk looking to downsize, or an insightful investor, each come with their own challenges and unique opportunity to walk through the process of buying or selling.</p>

            <p>After filling out the form below, I'll reach out to setup a time to meet. This is a time to go over your needs, wants, goals, and maybe grab a bite or a coffee.</p>
            <p>Then we'll get right down to business. Whether you're buying a home, selling a home, or investing in one, I'll walk you through every step of the process. As we hone in on what you're looking for, I'll continue to provide my suggestions and expertise.</p>
            <p>Something I've discovered in real estate is that it's often about solving problems, and those problems are always associate with surprises that come along. I enjoy solving these issues in a way that best suits you, so that you can focus on the things that truely matter.</p>
